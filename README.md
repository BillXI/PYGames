## Hangman
How to play:

```
% python3 hangman.py3
```
Enter the letter you want to guess and press enter. It will reveal the location of the letter you guessed in the target word - But be quick because you only get to guess 4 times before you are hung!


## Wordguessing
How to play:

```
% python3 mainframe.py3
```
Start by choosing how many characters you want to reveal. You then have to guess the word that is made up with the given characters. You will gain points if you guess a valid word. You can use * as a wildcard to replace any one vowel.


## Numberguessing
How to play:
```
% python3 numberguesser.py3
```
Guess the number between 1 and 100. The program will tell you if you need to guess higher or lower.

## Blackjack
How to play: 
```
% python3 blackjack.py3
```
You are trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over! The player that's closest wins.

## Tetris
Tetris is a computer game invented by Alexey Pajitnov in 1985 at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia. Tetris was part of the classic handheld Game Boy console.

The objective of Tetris is to complete full solid lines (no gaps). When you make a line it disappears and all the blocks shift accordingly. If you let the blocks reach the top of the Tetris board, you lose. You cannot win a Tetris game, though you can attempt to get the high score.
